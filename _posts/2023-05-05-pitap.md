# PI-TAP
## Physical network monitoring device

The goal of this project, is to use a raspberry pi as a network tap in order to monitor and possibly steal credentials from targeted computers on a network.
some of the information is redacted to protect the idenity of the server owners. Over All this project was very informative as it was my first physical recon project.


## Network Map

## PCAP File retrevial
The PCAP files could be accessed remotely from the tap by connecting to the taps own wireless network, after connecting you would be able to visit the taps internal python server and download recent PCAP files.

## Handling PCAP Files
In order to manage the incoming flow of PCAP files i made a simple script to automate the capture, storage, and deletion of PCAP files.
```
#!/bin/bash

# Program: Tap 
# Author: gh0st_D3V
# Version: 3.1

# Set up a trap to handle the SIGINT signal
trap 'echo "Exiting script..."; exit' SIGINT

# Initialize variables
status="stopped"
capture_duration=3600

# Function to display menu options
display_menu() {
    echo "1. Start packet capture"
    echo "2. Stop packet capture"
    echo "3. Set capture duration (default is 1 hour)"
    echo "4. Exit script"
}

# Function to start packet capture
start_capture() {
    status="running"
    while :
    do
        # Check the available space on the hard drive
        available_space=$(df -h / | awk '{print $5}' | tail -n 1 | cut -d '%' -f 1)
        echo "Available disk space: $available_space%"

        # If the available space is less than 10%
        if [ $available_space -le 10 ]
        then
            # Remove the oldest .pcap file
            oldest_file=$(ls -t /home/gh0st/Documents/pi-taps/*.pcap | tail -n 1)
            rm -f $oldest_file
        fi

        # Get the current month, day, hour, and minute in the format MM-DD_HH:MM
        datetime=$(date +"%m-%d_%H:%M")

        # Start tcpdump and save output to a file with the current month, day, hour, and minute as the name
        echo "Capturing packets for $capture_duration seconds to pi-tap-$datetime.pcap..."
        tcpdump -i br0 -w /home/gh0st/Documents/pi-taps/pi-tap-$datetime.pcap &

        # Sleep for the specified duration
        sleep $capture_duration

        # Kill the tcpdump process
        kill $!

        # Check if the script has been stopped
        if [ $status == "stopped" ]
        then
            break
        fi
    done
}

# Function to stop packet capture
stop_capture() {
    status="stopped"
    echo "Packet capture stopped."
}

# Function to handle menu selections
while :
do
    display_menu
    read -p "Enter your selection: " selection

    case $selection in
        1) start_capture;;
        2) stop_capture;;
        3) read -p "Enter capture duration in seconds (default is 3600): " capture_duration;;
        4) exit;;
        *) echo "Invalid selection.";;
    esac
done

```
 Also installed on the tap was the tool Responder inorder to capture NTML hashes. In the future it would be a good idea to use another tool like pretender.
